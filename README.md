# luacpp
simple c++ wrapper for lua

## Why another library?
Well the answer is simple. I just wanted to. For me the best way to learn something is to do it on my own. I had to implement Lua for work and got the permission to publish my wrapper on github :)

## Building
Luacpp requires at least c++17. If your compiler supports c++20 and you have cmake with a version of at least 3.28 then you'll have the option to compile the library as c++20 modules.

## Usage
